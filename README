What is ALLENMINER?
-------------------
ALLENMINER searches for genes that express in patterns of interest in the
developing or adult mouse Allen Brain Atlases (ABA).

It can search in any region of interest for genes that:
1. express
2. express specifically
3. express non-uniformly
4. express in a graded fashion
5. express in a pattern similar to a query gene

The region of interest can be specified as a set of brain region names or as
x,y,z bounds of a cuboid region of interest.

The code includes several routines that are generally useful for processing ABA
data files, including parsers for XML and XPZ files. Besides accessing the
raw data, these routines are useful for visualizing ABA expression files on
platforms where the ABA BrainExplorer application is not available (eg,
GNU/Linux). For example, all ABA expression files can be converted to PDB
(protein data bank) format for visualization in protein structure viewers, such
as PyMOL (http://pymol.org).

I began to develop ALLENMINER at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus and continue
to maintain it at NIH/NIAMS.

What's new?
------------
Version 2.1 is compatible with the latest adult (v7) and developing (v6) brain
atlases.


Documentation
-------------
docs/allenminer_user_manual.pdf offers detailed instruction on
installation and usage. This README offers a quick guide to a small
subset of the features.

o What is ALLENMINER?
---------------------

ALLENMINER is a software package that performs expression queries of
user-specified regions of the developing and adult mouse brains using the 3D
expression data in the Allen Brain Atlas. It can identify genes that are (1)
expressed, (2) expressed specifically, (3) expressed non-uniformly, (4)
expressed in a graded fashion, or (5) expressed in a pattern similar to a query
gene, in a user-specified region of interest of the mouse brain. The region of
interest can be specified as a set of ABA reference brain region names or as
x,y,z bounds of a cuboid region of interest.

The code includes several routines that are generally useful for processing ABA
data files, including parsers for the XML and XPZ files. Besides accessing the
raw data, these routines are useful for visualizing ABA expression files on
platforms where the ABA BrainExplorer application is not available (eg,
GNU/Linux). For example, all ABA expression files can be converted to PDB
(protein data bank) format for visualization in protein structure viewers, such
as PyMOL (http://pymol.org).

I began to develop ALLENMINER at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus and continue
to maintain it at NIH/NIAMS.

o What's new?

Updated to the latest ABA releases of the adult (v7) and developing (v6) atlases


o NEWS: PRE-RELEASE VERSION: 2015 Nov 6
---------------------------------------

* WARNING: The fastsearch indices for this pre-release version have not been
  created yet -- until I do so, you must download the entire expression atlas
  to use ALLENMINER.


o Documentation
---------------

 docs/allenminer_user_manual.pdf offers detailed instruction on
 installation and usage. This README offers a quick guide to a small
 subset of the features.

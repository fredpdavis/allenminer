o What is ALLENMINER?
---------------------

ALLENMINER is a software package that performs expression queries of
user-specified regions of the developing and adult mouse brains using the 3D
expression data in the Allen Brain Atlas. It can identify genes that are (1)
expressed, (2) expressed specifically, (3) expressed non-uniformly, (4)
expressed in a graded fashion, or (5) expressed in a pattern similar to a query
gene, in a user-specified region of interest of the mouse brain. The region of
interest can be specified as a set of ABA reference brain region names or as
x,y,z bounds of a cuboid region of interest.

The code includes several routines that are generally useful for processing ABA
data files, including parsers for the XML and XPZ files. Besides accessing the
raw data, these routines are useful for visualizing ABA expression files on
platforms where the ABA BrainExplorer application is not available (eg,
GNU/Linux). For example, all ABA expression files can be converted to PDB
(protein data bank) format for visualization in protein structure viewers, such
as PyMOL (http://pymol.org).

I developed ALLENMINER as a postdoc at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus.

o What is new in ALLENMINER v2.01?

Updated to latest adult mouse brain atlas (v3).

o What was new in ALLENMINER v2.0?

1. It was udpated to reflect changes in the Allen Brain Atlas:

 *  The latest adult brain reference atlas (v2) offers nearly 600 more brain
    region definitions than the previous version.

 *  The file formats and web data accessibility have changed slightly. For
    example, the main 3D adult data is no longer released in XPR file format,
    but instead uses a format similar to the XPZ used by the old developing
    atlas (which is also now deprecated). The old parsing routines are kept
    for legacy data and for other datasets that havent migrated yet, such as
    the sleeping mouse study.

2. Spinal expression database can now be searched using flexible queries.

3. Easier to install and run


o Documentation
---------------

 docs/allenminer_user_manual.pdf offers detailed instruction on
 installation and usage. This README offers a quick guide to a small
 subset of the features.

Besides accessing the\r\nraw data, these routines are useful for visualizing ABA expression files on\r\nplatforms where the ABA BrainExplorer application is not available (eg,\r\nGNU/Linux). For example, all ABA expression files can be converted to PDB\r\n(protein data bank) format for visualization in protein structure viewers, such\r\nas PyMOL (http://pymol.org).\r\n\r\nFor more details take a look at the users manual.\r\n\r\n### What's new in v2.1? (2015 Dec 10)\r\nVersion 2.1 is compatible with the latest adult (v7) and developing (v6) brain\r\natlases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### External Software\r\nThe program requires four programs, usually installed on most machines: [Perl](http://www.perl.org), [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget), unzip, and gzip.\r\nMac OS/X machines may not have wget by default, so check and download if necessary.\r\n[PyMol](http://www.pymol.org/) or other PDB viewers are useful to visualize ROI partition definitions when performing a graded or patterning query.\r\n\r\n### Citing ALLENMINER\r\n[A tool for identification of genes expressed in patterns of interest using the Allen Brain Atlas.](\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp288)\r\nF.
